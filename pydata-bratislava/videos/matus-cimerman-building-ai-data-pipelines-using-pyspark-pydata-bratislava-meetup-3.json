  "description": "Event description:\n\nExponea is full-stack Omni-channel real-time marketing cloud. In Exponea, we are extensively building practical AI applications varying from predictions or recommendations to simple simulated annealing. Regardless of application we are building, each one needs data. A lot of data that Exponea can efficiently provide.\n\nMajor issue, when building any AI application or ML model, is data preprocessing. This problem arises when you need to process vast volume datasets or high velocity data streams. We build such data pipelines mostly using Spark respectively PySpark and Python, but also many other tools are adopted.\n\nIn this talk we will go through the steps we implemented to build such pipelines. We will show you how to get Spark running easily, basic data wrangling with PySpark and Spark Streaming. In the end, we will use our data pipeline for real application and finish talk about resource managing joys and sorrows.\n\nAbout speaker:\n\nMatus Cimerman\n\n1+y Data science @Exponea, before BI intern and other stuff @Orange.\n\nFinishing masters FIIT STU, thesis: Data stream analysis\n\nhttps://github.com/cimox\n\n/redirect?redir_token=NZJ9UOWMm8zIDkbZJjgUKIZAcxh8MTUxOTU1MzA3OUAxNTE5NDY2Njc5&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fin%2Fmat%25C3%25BA%25C5%25A1-cimerman-4b08b352%2F&event=video_description&v=b0gDfCptNOk\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MatusCimerman\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/matus.cimerman\n\nRegistration:\n\n@Eventbrite registration here & @Meetup.com group's event here (if you use both your seat is guarateed). +our event you can find also @Facebook here.\n\n[Disclaimer: If you just mark \"going\" @Facebook event we can't guarantee your seat]\n\nLanguage of the event: Python & English\n\n-.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.-\nPyData Bratislava [Python Data Enthusiasts and Users, Data Scientists & Statisticians of all levels from Slovakia]\n\n-.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.-\n\nThis meetup group is for Data Scientists, Statisticians, Economists and Data Enthusiasts using Python for data analysis and data visualization. The goals are to provide Python enthusiasts a place to share ideas and learn from each other about how best to apply the language and tools to ever-evolving challenges in the vast realm of data management, processing, analytics, and visualization.\n--\nPyData is a group for users and developers of data analysis tools to share ideas and learn from each other. We gather to discuss how best to apply Python tools, as well as those using R and Julia, to meet the evolving challenges in data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData groups, events, and conferences aim to provide a venue for users acrossall the various domains of data analysis to share their experiences and their techniques. PyData is organized by NumFOCUS.org, a 501(c)3 non-profit in the United States.\n\nThe PyData \u200bCode of Conduct\u200b governs this meetup. To discuss any issues or concerns relating to the code of conduct or the behavior of anyone at a PyData meetup, please contact the organizer or NumFOCUS Executive Director Leah Silen (+1512-222-5449; leah@numfocus.org).\n-.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.-\n\nOur PyData Bratislava (Facebook group) you can find here: /redirect?redir_token=NZJ9UOWMm8zIDkbZJjgUKIZAcxh8MTUxOTU1MzA3OUAxNTE5NDY2Njc5&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fgroups%2F1813599648877946%2F&event=video_description&v=b0gDfCptNOk\n\nOur PyData Bratislava (Twitter account) here: https://twitter.com/PyDataBA\n\nOur PyData Bratislava (LinkedIn group) here: https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13506080\n-.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.--.-\nGapData Institute (GDI) is a nonprofit nonpartisan research institution harnessing power of data & wisdom of economics for public good. || Data.
