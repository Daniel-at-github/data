We gather to discuss how best to apply Python tools, as well as those using R and Julia, to meet the evolving challenges in data management, processing, analytics, and visualization. PyData groups, events, and conferences aim to provide a venue for users acrossall the various domains of data analysis to share their experiences and their techniques. PyData is organized by NumFOCUS.org, a 501(c)3 non-profit in the United States.\n\nThe PyData \u200bCode of Conduct\u200b governs this meetup.
